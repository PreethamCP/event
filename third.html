    <p>Modern space research in india can be traced to 1920s, when scientist S.K Mitra conducted a experiment sounding the ionosphere 
        After 1945 developments were made in coordinated space research in india by scientist: Vikram Sarabhai and Homi Bhabha.Initial experiments included study of cosmic radiation,high altitude and air borne testing.The INCOSPAR was setup in 1962 by the Prime Minister Jawharlal Nehru.A series of sounding rocket named Rohini was developed and started from 1967 ownwards.

  Aryabhata was India's first satellite,[3] named after the famous Indian astronomer.[7] It was launched on 19 April 1975[3] from Kapustin Yar, a Soviet rocket launch and development site in Astrakhan Oblast using a Kosmos-3M launch vehicle. It was built by ISRO, and launched by the Soviet Union as a part of the Soviet Interkosmos programme which provided access to space for friendly states.
Launch

It was launched by India on 19 April 1975[3] from Kapustin Yar, a Russian rocket launch and development site in Astrakhan Oblast using a Kosmos-3M launch vehicle. It was built by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).[8] The launch came from an agreement between India and the Soviet Union directed by UR Rao and signed in 1972. It allowed the USSR to use Indian ports for tracking ships and launching vessels in return for launching various different Indian satellites.[9]

On 19 April 1975, the satellite's 96.46-minute orbit had an apogee of 619 kilometres (385 mi) and a perigee of 563 kilometres (350 mi), at an inclination of 50.7 degrees.[6][1] It was built to conduct experiments in X-ray astronomy, aeronomics, and solar physics. The spacecraft was a 26-sided polyhedron 1.4 metres (4.6 ft) in diameter. All faces (except the top and bottom) were covered with solar cells.[5] A power failure halted experiments after four days and 60 orbits with all signals from the spacecraft lost after five days of operation.[2] Spacecraft mainframe remained active till March 1981.[1] Due to orbital decay the satellite entered Earth's atmosphere on 10 February 1992.[1]
