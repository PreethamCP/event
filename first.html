  Chandrayaan-3 (/ˌtʃʌndrəˈjɑːn/) is the third mission in the Chandrayaan programme, a series of lunar-exploration missions developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).[7] Launched in July 2023, the mission consists of a lunar lander named Vikram and a lunar rover named Pragyan, similar to those launched aboard Chandrayaan-2 in 2019.

  Chandrayaan-3 was launched from Satish Dhawan Space Centre on 14 July 2023. The spacecraft entered lunar orbit on 5 August, and the lander touched down in the lunar south polar region[8] on 23 August at 12:33 UTC, making India the fourth country to successfully land on the Moon, and the first to do so near the lunar south pole.[9][10][11]
