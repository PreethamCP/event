    <p>Modern space research in india can be traced to 1920s, when scientist S.K Mitra conducted a experiment sounding the ionosphere 
        After 1945 developments were made in coordinated space research in india by scientist: Vikram Sarabhai and Homi Bhabha.Initial experiments included study of cosmic radiation,high altitude and air borne testing.The INCOSPAR was setup in 1962 by the Prime Minister Jawharlal Nehru.A series of sounding rocket named Rohini was developed and started from 1967 ownwards.

  Chandrayaan-1 (pronunciationi; from Sanskrit: Chandra, "Moon" and yāna, "craft, vehicle")[6] was the first Indian lunar probe under the Chandrayaan programme. It was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in October 2008, and operated until August 2009. The mission included an orbiter and a MIP. India launched the spacecraft using a PSLV-XL rocket on 22 October 2008 at 00:52 UTC from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh.[7] The mission was a major boost to India's space program, as India researched and developed indigenous technology to explore the Moon.[8] The vehicle was inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008.

  On 14 November 2008, the Moon Impact Probe separated from the Chandrayaan orbiter at 14:36 UTC and struck the south pole in a controlled manner. The probe hit near the crater Shackleton at 15:01 UTC.[9][10][11][12] The location of impact was named Jawahar Point.[13] With this mission, ISRO became the fifth national space agency to reach the lunar surface. Other nations whose national space agencies to have done so prior were the former Soviet Union in 1959,[14] the United States in 1962,[15] Japan in 1993,[16] and ESA member states in 2006.[17][18][19]
  
  With an estimated cost for the project was ₹386 crore (US$88.73 million), it was intended to survey the lunar surface over a two-year period, to produce a complete map of the chemical composition at the surface and three-dimensional topography. The polar regions are of special interest as they might contain water ice.[20][21] Among its many achievements was the discovery of widespread presence of water molecules in lunar soil.[22]
  
  After almost a year, the orbiter started experiencing several technical issues including failure of the star tracker and poor thermal shielding; Chandrayaan-1 stopped communicating at about 20:00 UTC on 28 August 2009, shortly after which the ISRO officially declared that the mission was over. Chandrayaan-1 operated for 312 days as opposed to the intended two years; however the mission achieved most of its scientific objectives including detecting presence of Lunar water.[5][23][24][25]
  
  On 2 July 2016, NASA used ground-based radar systems to relocate Chandrayaan-1 in its lunar orbit, almost seven years after it shut down.[26][27] Repeated observations over the next three months allowed a precise determination of its orbit which varies between 150 and 270 km (93 and 168 mi) in altitude every two years.[28]
