    <p>Modern space research in india can be traced to 1920s, when scientist S.K Mitra conducted a experiment sounding the ionosphere 
        After 1945 developments were made in coordinated space research in india by scientist: Vikram Sarabhai and Homi Bhabha.Initial experiments included study of cosmic radiation,high altitude and air borne testing.The INCOSPAR was setup in 1962 by the Prime Minister Jawharlal Nehru.A series of sounding rocket named Rohini was developed and started from 1967 ownwards.

  The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), unofficially known as Mangalyaan,[11] (from Sanskrit: Mangala, "Mars" and yƒÅna, "craft, vehicle")[12][13] was a space probe orbiting Mars since 24 September 2014. It was launched on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).[14][15][16][17] It was India's first interplanetary mission[18] and it made ISRO the fourth space agency to achieve Mars orbit, after Roscosmos, NASA, and the European Space Agency.[19] It made India the first Asian nation to reach the Martian orbit and the first nation in the world to do so on its maiden attempt.[20][21][22][23]

The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at 09:08 UTC on 5 November 2013.[5][24] The launch window was approximately 20 days long and started on 28 October 2013.[6] The MOM probe spent about a month in Earth orbit, where it made a series of seven apogee-raising orbital manoeuvres before trans-Mars injection on 30 November 2013 (UTC).[25] After a 298-day transit to Mars, it was put into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014.

The mission was a "technology demonstrator" project to develop the technologies for designing, planning, management, and operations of an interplanetary mission.[26] It carried five scientific instruments.[27] The spacecraft was monitored from the Spacecraft Control Centre at ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) in Bengaluru with support from the Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) antennae at Bengaluru, Karnataka.[28]

On 2 October 2022, it was reported that the orbiter had irrecoverably lost communications with Earth after entering a seven-hour eclipse period in April 2022 that it was not designed to survive.[29][30][31] The following day, ISRO released a statement that all attempts to revive MOM had failed and officially declared it dead, citing the loss of fuel and battery power to the probe's instruments.[
